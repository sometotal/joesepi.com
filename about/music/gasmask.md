Gathering only when the gathering was good. Four people and a few machines captured what is gas(mask). Like antennaes, they wrangled only the pure and obscure tangling frequencies with the gods to obtain the muse that is music. Never planning, never compromising, incorporating all that was available, GasMasK played while other things worked. Envision and enjoy what we are all a part of and put on a mask that is a gas.
