I am a very experienced software engineer who has focused on JavaScript and front end technologies throughout my 17 year career in technology. I have managed engineering teams and built applications used by millions ([Adobe](http://adobe.com), [New York Times](http://nytimes.com), [Credit Suisse](https://www.credit-suisse.com/us/en.html), [Sears](http://sears.com), [Ogilvy](http://ogilvy.com)). I stay on top of the ever-evolving landscape of tools and techniques and am eager to help create what comes next. I am also very passionate about [supporting and engaging the engineering community](/dev-advocate) and am the co-organizer of one of NYC's more successful developer groups, [NYCHTML5](http://meetup.com/nychtml5).
