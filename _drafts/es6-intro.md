I have been wanting to write about ES2015 because I love the power and convenience it provides. (Note: ES2015 was called ES6 and previously referred to as "Harmony". More on that below.) I had put off writing about the new proposed standard though; I had wrongly assumed that everyone already knew the awesomeness of ES2015 and that everyone was already using it in sweet bliss. I feel very fortunate to work on a talented team here at Behance, but that can b. I realized I was in the ES when I was interviewing a dev the other day (albeit a jr dev) and he said he couldn't use ES6 until it had more brower support. I wanted to yell out "NO! BABEL! USE ES6 NOW!!!" But I didn't. I instead questioned him further to get him to realize it himself.

I realized in that moment: despite the proliferation of ES6 posts and articles, I am going to do my part by contributing to the cornicopia of resources with the hopes that more people will jump on board and take the bullet train to the future.

So let's begin with a little background and then we will start getting setup.

## A little background first

#### History

You may have noticed that I first mentioned ES6/2015. That is because the current standard is at ES5 (ECMAScript 5th edition) and the next version is being standardized, thus originally called ES6. This is similar to how HTML5 is now technically just HTML, JavaScript is moving toward a rolling yearly reference to new features and so, the term ES6 has now become ES2015. This is a good move as we wont be tied to these big releases of a new version that take forever and so on. New features can be added on a rolling basis and we can advance in a more smooth bit by bit way. This is somewhat akin to the concept of semver or how browsers are updating more regularly rather than major release IE 10 => 11, for instance.

#### Goals of the new version

With this new version they wanted to advance the language without sacrificing backwards compatibility.

## Setup Getup

#### Tools

Gulp?
Babel
JSHint and JSCS

#### Is Transpile even a word?

Let's look at some transpiled code

## Features

#### Just a little toe-dip

A couple basics: const and let

## Until next time

Next time, we'll get into some syntactical sugar sweetness, like destructuring and splats.
