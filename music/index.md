title: Joe Sepi and the many musical outlets
---

Joe Sepi has been playing music since he was 14. He started out playing heavy metal in high school around Saratoga. He and some friends moved to Boise, ID in 1991 to start a band. It was the year punk broke. It was the year grunge exploded. Boise was an amazing place with a tight knit music community, which at the time included Built to Spill, some of whom were roomates with Joe. After playing in a few bands in Boise, he moved up to Olympia, WA, where he met a lot of people from Chicago. The music scene in OlyWA was rich, considering how small the city is. There was an amazing amount of great bands and record labels at that time, including KARP, Unwound, 31 Knots and K Records, Punk in my Vitamins, and Kill Rock Stars. After playing in a few bands in OlyWA, Joe drove around the country for 5 weeks and ended up in Bennington, VT. He played drums in a band there, despite his lack of drum talent. It was a small town, so you take what you can get. Boredom sets in quickly in sleep Vermont. Soon he was beckoned to Chicago to rendezvous with all those characters he met in Olympia. Chicago was a good decade of great music creation and performance. Joe spent around a decade around NYC and up in the Hudson Valley, including Peekskill, where Least Best Beast was born and thrived. He can now be found around New Haven, CT, giving life to his new band, Magnus. Always good things ahead.

There are tons of great stories about each band and location. More on that later...
