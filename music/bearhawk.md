*"They feel like your favorite pair of jeans. They're frickin sweet!"* - Nameless fan at sold-out Metro with Built to Spill.

BEARHAWK is on the indie-lover's must-have list for a reason, they effortlessly deliver sounds that are musically massive and drive people. They're a 4-boy quartet from Chicago with serious range. They say what you want your rock bands to say, and they sound like that tantrum you had last week.

When you get the album you'll notice everything from organs and acoustics, to Sepi shredding your room in half with a solo. There are walls of sound that will make you want to break something. Which is perfect because, Jim's symbols sound like rocks breaking glass. You will get moved. Especially when the meat of the songs is introduced. Jon's bass plays like it's in the hands of God's little brother. And God's little brother rips.

This phenomenon called BEARHAWK is all too weird considering these guys are simple organic midwest. Chances are you've seen one of them on the street. They're charm is born of honesty and endless creativity. They surf the lake, (that's right) bike the shore, hug dogs and rock crowds. These are the guys you don't want anyone else to know about so they can be all yours.
