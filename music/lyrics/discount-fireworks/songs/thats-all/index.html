<h1>That's All</h1>
<p>In this world<br>
And in this song<br>
My mind's made up<br>
There's nothing wrong<br>
Widdle away<br>
What don't belong<br>
I didn't say<br>
You couldn't be wrong<br>
That's All</p>
<p>I see the words<br>
Written on the wall<br>
Take a number<br>
Waiting to be called<br>
So long</p>
<p>It's all wrong<br>
But it won't take long<br>
It's taken too many songs<br>
To get this far<br>
Sail alone some<br>
Never reach the sun<br>
There you are</p>
<p>See it all<br>
Life goes on<br>
The wheels are turning<br>
Moving you along<br>
It's so fucking real<br>
And I can't get on<br>
Let's just make a deal<br>
To feel a little less alone<br>
Wrong, wrong, I'll tell you in a song whether it is right or wrong</p>
<p>This hotel<br>
This is home<br>
The keys are far gone<br>
Somewhere in the hall<br>
Sail alone some<br>
Never accept the bomb<br>
Right or wrong<br>
... So long</p>
