# Sweet Lil

Sweet Little Jesus, won't ya sing me a song?

Tell me about Japan now  
Can those kids dance?  
I hear they really fill the standhouse  
Something grand

Justice sky  
To the city ground  
And the jets up high  
Can see me now

Sweet Little Jesus, won't ya sing me a song?

Tell me about your campground  
The way that suzie talks  
I hear you really move the madhouse  
Everyone of them walks

Justice sky  
To the city ground  
And the jets up high  
Can see me now  
And I'm just a guy  
Who has been around  
And the jets up high  
Can see me now

Blasphemy / Blast for me  
Turn back cold of winter  
Take back last september  
Make life much more simpler  
Make that I remember

Tell me about your pants now  
Are they worldwide?  
They really fit your can well  
Why would I lie?

Justice sky  
To the city ground  
And the jets up high  
Can see me now  
And I'm just a guy  
Who has been around

And the jets up high
Can see me now
