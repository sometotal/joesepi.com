<h1>Hana Hou</h1>
<p>Jumped into a perfect time her lips were almost home<br>
Sweetness take a pic of this one half could make it whole<br>
When she got off the train<br>
And jumped into my truck again<br>
The crowd chants hana hou</p>
<p>With a smirk she called me darling and said lets go<br>
Said that there was a little damage, and thought that I should know<br>
Some ska with Scottish Dave<br>
Found a bench at the beach real late<br>
The crowd chants hana hou</p>
<p>Gonna ride a north shore wave<br>
Dirt queen without breath haole<br>
Gonna skate the day away</p>
