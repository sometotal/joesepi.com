# Dead Feeling

Head lights in the night come to see me  
But they just fade away  
Thought twice of what is and what could be  
If nothing gets in the way

In the street is a young man who grew up  
Six feet two inches high  
But when he looks up  
What does he see  
A warm shelter or a darkened sky?

Got high for someone who could lift me  
Both pretty and strong  
Fell asleep for a moment in the warm light  
Just a little too long

Injured fool who don’t know he’s been hurt  
He just covers his eyes  
But when he looks out  
Does he still doubt  
What he knows he’s always had there inside 

I been feeling  
The death of feeling  
When will it end  
I just don’t want to feel more

I get lost in the weeds of your weakness  
With just one look in the eye  
I find it difficult to find favor  
But I still gotta try

The steps you won’t take just to meet me  
Half way up the drive  
Why don’t you grow up  
You’re the grown up  
Lets make the most of the days we’re alive 

I’ve been feeling  
A new feeling  
On the mend  
And I really wanna feel more

Can’t you see the damage that you cause  
the hole you dig and dig the days get shorter  
Looking deep for the piece that could make us  
Whole the wait will surely soon be over  
Make the most of the moment to seize on  
co—vert narcissist the new disorder  
Can’t wait for the plan for this two point  
Ohhh tell me it will soon be over
