# Heliocentric Model

I hear the car door slamming shut  
Broken arrows under my foot  
And they're pointing at you  
A heliocentric model  
With you in the center of the sun

No cares for my cares  
Nothing means enough  
For you  
The only star in the universe  
To do everything first

The comfort of everyone  
Is to know that you haven't won  
Fuck You  
I hope this song ends first  
Before the second verse

What happened last night  
Got in a fight  
Someone half right  
Turned out the light  
What happened last night  
Got in a fight

You keep coming  
Round and round you just keep coming  

And it's all about you

Before you ever came to town  
I knew that things wouldn't be so good  
And now loves turned me around  
And now you've eaten all my food  
You never knew which way to go  
You should've headed up to the snow  
Up to the mountains  
Where there's more snow
