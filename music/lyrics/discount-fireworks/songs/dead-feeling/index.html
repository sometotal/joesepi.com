<h1>Dead Feeling</h1>
<p>Head lights in the night come to see me<br>
But they just fade away<br>
Thought twice of what is and what could be<br>
If nothing gets in the way</p>
<p>In the street is a young man who grew up<br>
Six feet two inches high<br>
But when he looks up<br>
What does he see<br>
A warm shelter or a darkened sky?</p>
<p>Got high for someone who could lift me<br>
Both pretty and strong<br>
Fell asleep for a moment in the warm light<br>
Just a little too long</p>
<p>Injured fool who don’t know he’s been hurt<br>
He just covers his eyes<br>
But when he looks out<br>
Does he still doubt<br>
What he knows he’s always had there inside</p>
<p>I been feeling<br>
The death of feeling<br>
When will it end<br>
I just don’t want to feel more</p>
<p>I get lost in the weeds of your weakness<br>
With just one look in the eye<br>
I find it difficult to find favor<br>
But I still gotta try</p>
<p>The steps you won’t take just to meet me<br>
Half way up the drive<br>
Why don’t you grow up<br>
You’re the grown up<br>
Lets make the most of the days we’re alive</p>
<p>I’ve been feeling<br>
A new feeling<br>
On the mend<br>
And I really wanna feel more</p>
<p>Can’t you see the damage that you cause<br>
the hole you dig and dig the days get shorter<br>
Looking deep for the piece that could make us<br>
Whole the wait will surely soon be over<br>
Make the most of the moment to seize on<br>
co—vert narcissist the new disorder<br>
Can’t wait for the plan for this two point<br>
Ohhh tell me it will soon be over</p>
