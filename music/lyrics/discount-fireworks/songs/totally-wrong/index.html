<h1>Totally wrong</h1>
<p>You are totally wrong<br>
I should write you a song<br>
I could tell right from the  start you were hitting the bong (damn)<br>
At the beginning…  we were singing…  both of our songs<br>
I want to sail away<br>
Come back with more swords on another day</p>
<p>You say you wont you know you will<br>
Wouldn’t want to die upon that hill<br>
Couldn’t leave well enough alone<br>
Shoulda wrote it in a poem</p>
<p>You were totally gone<br>
When you pulled up in your Cadillac right next to my home (damn)<br>
I want to sail away<br>
Come back with more force to blow you away</p>
<p>When you were gone<br>
I wrote you this song<br>
I took you apart<br>
And put you back wrong</p>
<p>You say you were strong<br>
But you were totally wrong<br>
When the going got tough<br>
You were totally gone</p>
<p>Holy shit!<br>
Did you see that?<br>
Did you see what he pulled out his hat?</p>
<p>When you were one<br>
The parts were the sum<br>
The best was the rest<br>
And it was still yet to come</p>
<p>The way you went long<br>
Turned left and were gone<br>
In the blink of an eye<br>
Unlimited brawn</p>
<p>Wish you were now<br>
Totally gone<br>
Thought we knew real love<br>
Totally wrong</p>
<p>They think that you’re ill<br>
From the wind comes the will<br>
Look once from the sill<br>
And go in for the kill</p>
<p>Bright lights in the dark<br>
Hit it out of the park<br>
Where the west was won<br>
They’ve made you a gun</p>
<p>Holy shit!<br>
Did you see that?<br>
Did you see what he pulled out his hat?</p>
<p>This song should be sung<br>
From the back to the front<br>
Spoke highly of you<br>
Except when they called you a cunt</p>
<p>This is the end<br>
My only friend<br>
This is the end<br>
Here we are again</p>
<p>Wish you were now<br>
Totally gone<br>
Thought we knew real love<br>
Totally wrong</p>
