# That's All

In this world  
And in this song  
My mind's made up  
There's nothing wrong  
Widdle away  
What don't belong  
I didn't say  
You couldn't be wrong  
That's All

I see the words  
Written on the wall  
Take a number  
Waiting to be called  
So long

It's all wrong  
But it won't take long  
It's taken too many songs  
To get this far  
Sail alone some  
Never reach the sun  
There you are

See it all  
Life goes on  
The wheels are turning  
Moving you along  
It's so fucking real  
And I can't get on  
Let's just make a deal  
To feel a little less alone  
Wrong, wrong, I'll tell you in a song whether it is right or wrong

This hotel  
This is home  
The keys are far gone  
Somewhere in the hall  
Sail alone some  
Never accept the bomb  
Right or wrong  
... So long
