# Slow Burn

I knew this song wouldn’t last forever  
But I can’t seem to let you go  
I wonder how you’re doing in this weather  
If you’ll put up with the nutmeg snow 

Way down Slow burn

Your potential creative endeavors  
Made me once want to hop on board  
But I can’t seem to make sense of these letters  
You’re using to write this song 

Way down Slow burn

A broken bench can’t hold us together  
Not with the weight of all this cold  
I really wonder if you’ll get better

Way down Slow burn
