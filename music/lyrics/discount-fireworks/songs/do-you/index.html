<h1>Do You</h1>
<p>Ooh oooh ooh ooooh</p>
<p>Gonna have to wait<br>
For this time to elapse<br>
We all pass the plate<br>
But there aint much left in cash<br>
You carried half the weight<br>
But you took all the stash<br>
Give em half a shake<br>
A high five that’s cut in half</p>
<p>You set em up to fall down<br>
Its what you do. Do you<br>
You set em up to fall down and down</p>
<p>Its a terrible state<br>
New Jersey plate to pass<br>
Its a worthless case<br>
Its the worst kind to have<br>
But we still up the stakes<br>
Nowhere left to go but back<br>
Oh but Couldn’t You Wait<br>
To get off your lazy ass?</p>
<p>You set em up to fall down<br>
Its what you do. Do you<br>
You set em up to fall down and down</p>
<p>Find a way to win<br>
Its the way that you fight<br>
Your right  / Your might</p>
