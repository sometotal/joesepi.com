<h1>Hurry Up And Wait</h1>
<p>Yeah c’mon!</p>
<p>I can see youre working // Can you spare a dime<br>
Charlie says you needs a nickel<br>
Can’t seem to find the time</p>
<p>We can double the edges // Sharpen both of the sides<br>
Dont you fuckin cut your hair<br>
Dont you know Its a sign of the times</p>
<p>Yeah cmon // Ya gotta give it to me // I wanna feel it</p>
<p>Charlie says you need some // Need to feel no pain<br>
he said its all in your head<br>
Find a way to get out of the rain</p>
<p>I can see youre working // And you wonder why<br>
With the walls around you closing<br>
Dont you know its a sign of the times</p>
<p>Yeah cmon // Ya gotta give it to me // I wanna feel it</p>
<p>How to suffer alone in outer space<br>
How to stuff a royal into a cage</p>
<p>I see you’ve got the gloves on // Wanna climb inside<br>
Wanna fight with the wind tonight<br>
Gonna sway from side to side</p>
<p>Gonna wear out the welcome // Wait around to die<br>
Gotta find the space to travel<br>
From within to the other side</p>
<p>Yeah cmon // Ya gotta give it to me // I wanna feel it</p>
<p>How to suffer alone in outer space<br>
How to stuff a royal into a cage</p>
