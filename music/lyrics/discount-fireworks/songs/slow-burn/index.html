<h1>Slow Burn</h1>
<p>I knew this song wouldn’t last forever<br>
But I can’t seem to let you go<br>
I wonder how you’re doing in this weather<br>
If you’ll put up with the nutmeg snow</p>
<p>Way down Slow burn</p>
<p>Your potential creative endeavors<br>
Made me once want to hop on board<br>
But I can’t seem to make sense of these letters<br>
You’re using to write this song</p>
<p>Way down Slow burn</p>
<p>A broken bench can’t hold us together<br>
Not with the weight of all this cold<br>
I really wonder if you’ll get better</p>
<p>Way down Slow burn</p>
