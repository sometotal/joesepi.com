5/4/Only

Only  
A space reserved for only me

Oh, I can find  
The forever light to blind  
Only

Oh Oh… Only  
One better sight that’s gone  
Dead end bulb awaits the light  
Only

What good is it all  
If you dont know how to fall  
You can’t get up You can’t get down Can’t you see?  
What comes around  
Goes around and smacks you down to the ground  
A pound of flesh is the least that you’ll be...

Oh Oh Oh Oh... Only

What good is it all  
If you dont know how to fall  
You can’t get up You can’t get down Can’t you see?  
What comes around  
Goes around and smacks you down to the ground  
A pound of flesh is the least that you’ll be...

You’re just staring at the ground  
Gotta get up get your feet  
Can’t hear a sound  
Come and stand next to me  
Waves floating around and around  
And around and around  
The winter, the heavens, the sea will come calling the swell is the last thing you’ll see

Oh Oh... Only  
What say you now you know  
The one who wakes the night  
Only
