# Frail Common Animal

She's a frail common animal  
She sings but she doesn't know the song  
She spells everything too long  
She swings but she does it just for fun  
She'll send you running to the store  
And a wince can tell you so much more  
She sails but she doesn't have a boat  
She's a frail common animal  
She stares through paper cups  
She can't see that doesn't get enough  
She's a frail common animal  
She's a frail common animal
