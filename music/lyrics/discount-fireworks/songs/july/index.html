<h1>July</h1>
<p>Discovered there’s a world less painted in the night<br>
Discolored in a rawness hidden from the light<br>
Hidden in a fortress kept well out of sight<br>
Held up as a portrait something isn’t right</p>
<p>Sedated in July</p>
<p>Standing on the stage set singing is a lie<br>
Holding this guitar neck saying it’s alright<br>
Could I just decide to stay up here all night<br>
Or pull the plug and call it; wave and say goodbye</p>
<p>Sedated in July</p>
<p>a world less painted in the night<br>
rawness hidden from the light<br>
in a fortress kept well out of sight<br>
portrait something isn’t right<br>
Sedated in July</p>
<p>Sedated in July</p>
