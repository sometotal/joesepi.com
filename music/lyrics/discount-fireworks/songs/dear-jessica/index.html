<h1>Dear Jessica</h1>
<p>Dear Jessica<br>
I really want to get next to ya<br>
And this note should really say it all</p>
<p>Dear Jessica<br>
I got a couple of questions for ya<br>
Oh would it be to early to<br>
Start holding hands</p>
<p>Dear Jessica<br>
I really wanna sit next to ya<br>
I got a couple of questions for ya<br>
Am I at the 'honey' point yet</p>
<p>Dear Jessica<br>
I really wanna sit next to ya<br>
In second period science class<br>
I got a couple of questions to ask<br>
In a little note to pass<br>
Dear Jessica<br>
Let me know if I'm rushing you...<br>
ok? see footnote, with an asterisk, but first</p>
<p>Thank you for saying yes<br>
The usual answers that I get are<br>
No way, Are you studid? No, I already have a boyfriend<br>
And sometimes I'm too damn shy<br>
To even ask a girl out but...</p>
<p>I haven't had a lot of girlfriends yet<br>
Just teach me what to do<br>
And what not to do<br>
Oh please, teach me what not to do<br>
What not to do<br>
Dear Jessica<br>
I really wanna sit next to ya<br>
In science class, second period<br>
Dear Jessica<br>
I wanna sit next to ya<br>
And are we at the 'honey' point yet?</p>
