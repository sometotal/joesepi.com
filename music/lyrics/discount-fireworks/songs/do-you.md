# Do You

Ooh oooh ooh ooooh

Gonna have to wait  
For this time to elapse  
We all pass the plate  
But there aint much left in cash  
You carried half the weight  
But you took all the stash  
Give em half a shake  
A high five that’s cut in half

You set em up to fall down  
Its what you do. Do you  
You set em up to fall down and down

Its a terrible state  
New Jersey plate to pass  
Its a worthless case  
Its the worst kind to have  
But we still up the stakes  
Nowhere left to go but back  
Oh but Couldn’t You Wait  
To get off your lazy ass?

You set em up to fall down  
Its what you do. Do you  
You set em up to fall down and down

Find a way to win  
Its the way that you fight  
Your right  / Your might
