# Hurry Up And Wait

Yeah c’mon!

I can see youre working // Can you spare a dime  
Charlie says you needs a nickel  
Can’t seem to find the time

We can double the edges // Sharpen both of the sides  
Dont you fuckin cut your hair  
Dont you know Its a sign of the times

Yeah cmon // Ya gotta give it to me // I wanna feel it

Charlie says you need some // Need to feel no pain  
he said its all in your head  
Find a way to get out of the rain

I can see youre working // And you wonder why  
With the walls around you closing  
Dont you know its a sign of the times

Yeah cmon // Ya gotta give it to me // I wanna feel it

How to suffer alone in outer space  
How to stuff a royal into a cage

I see you’ve got the gloves on // Wanna climb inside  
Wanna fight with the wind tonight  
Gonna sway from side to side

Gonna wear out the welcome // Wait around to die  
Gotta find the space to travel  
From within to the other side

Yeah cmon // Ya gotta give it to me // I wanna feel it

How to suffer alone in outer space  
How to stuff a royal into a cage
