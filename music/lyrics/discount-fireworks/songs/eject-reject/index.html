<h1>Eject Reject</h1>
<p>I saw you runnin from your mama up on 4th St, Eastside<br>
Great grandpapa left you something cherry bronco sweet ride<br>
Great grandmama call you up you said fuck off and good bye<br>
Real true story in the kitchen I was there with my own eyes</p>
<p>Eject, Reject<br>
Be Kind,  Rewind</p>
<p>You’ve got something born of nothing burnt down barnyard wheat high<br>
Real or imagined friend cadavers give you several high fives<br>
They’ll be books about crooks you avoided did time<br>
Brains and the know how, skipped the housegow where’d you end up, preach high</p>
<p>Eject, Reject<br>
Be Kind,  Rewind</p>
