<h1>Sweet Lil</h1>
<p>Sweet Little Jesus, won't ya sing me a song?</p>
<p>Tell me about Japan now<br>
Can those kids dance?<br>
I hear they really fill the standhouse<br>
Something grand</p>
<p>Justice sky<br>
To the city ground<br>
And the jets up high<br>
Can see me now</p>
<p>Sweet Little Jesus, won't ya sing me a song?</p>
<p>Tell me about your campground<br>
The way that suzie talks<br>
I hear you really move the madhouse<br>
Everyone of them walks</p>
<p>Justice sky<br>
To the city ground<br>
And the jets up high<br>
Can see me now<br>
And I'm just a guy<br>
Who has been around<br>
And the jets up high<br>
Can see me now</p>
<p>Blasphemy / Blast for me<br>
Turn back cold of winter<br>
Take back last september<br>
Make life much more simpler<br>
Make that I remember</p>
<p>Tell me about your pants now<br>
Are they worldwide?<br>
They really fit your can well<br>
Why would I lie?</p>
<p>Justice sky<br>
To the city ground<br>
And the jets up high<br>
Can see me now<br>
And I'm just a guy<br>
Who has been around</p>
<p>And the jets up high
Can see me now</p>
