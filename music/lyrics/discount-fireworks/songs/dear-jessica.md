# Dear Jessica

Dear Jessica  
I really want to get next to ya  
And this note should really say it all

Dear Jessica  
I got a couple of questions for ya  
Oh would it be to early to  
Start holding hands

Dear Jessica  
I really wanna sit next to ya  
I got a couple of questions for ya  
Am I at the 'honey' point yet

Dear Jessica  
I really wanna sit next to ya  
In second period science class  
I got a couple of questions to ask  
In a little note to pass  
Dear Jessica  
Let me know if I'm rushing you...  
ok? see footnote, with an asterisk, but first

Thank you for saying yes  
The usual answers that I get are  
No way, Are you studid? No, I already have a boyfriend  
And sometimes I'm too damn shy  
To even ask a girl out but...

I haven't had a lot of girlfriends yet  
Just teach me what to do  
And what not to do  
Oh please, teach me what not to do  
What not to do  
Dear Jessica  
I really wanna sit next to ya  
In science class, second period  
Dear Jessica  
I wanna sit next to ya  
And are we at the 'honey' point yet?
