Ooh...

I gotta feel at home when I move from here to there  
I’m gonna take up space even though I am nowhere  
Ooh... Dont Wait Dont Wait Dont Wait  
Waiting beside the phone

Waiting to be called  
Get away get away get away get away now  
Resist the urge to run from home  
Ooh... Dont Wait Dont Wait Dont Wait

No bed Not yet But worth the get  
What ails What’s worse is What lies ahead  
Ooh... Dont Wait Dont Wait Dont Wait

There’s something that pushes me to move and move and move  
Ooh... Dont Wait Dont Wait Dont Wait

Waiting to be called  
Get away get away get away get away now  
Resist the urge to run from home  
Ooh... Dont Wait Dont Wait Dont Wait
