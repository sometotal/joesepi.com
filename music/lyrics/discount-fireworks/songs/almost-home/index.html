<h1>Almost Home</h1>
<p>Almost home<br>
We barely made it<br>
We took too long<br>
To even start</p>
<p>Dip in the pond<br>
We can wade in<br>
Waving our arms<br>
And seein stars<br>
We could be wrong</p>
<p>Things have just stalled<br>
But they’ve been fading<br>
Waving our arms<br>
Was a good start<br>
We could be wrong<br>
We’re probably wrong<br>
We’re never wrong</p>
<p>Went down to the bar<br>
We took the ladies<br>
Taken by the arm<br>
Its the way it starts</p>
<p>Sit in the stall<br>
When we were waiting<br>
None of us alarmed<br>
Thought we were smart<br>
We could be wrong</p>
<p>Jokers for all<br>
I’ll see you later<br>
You dealt some good cards<br>
But now its dark<br>
We were so wrong<br>
Totally wrong<br>
We’re never wrong</p>
<p>You hurry home<br>
You stayed too long<br>
Past grave and stone<br>
You shout -- Save The Soul of The Song</p>
<p>Honesty disarms<br>
Leaves them lazy<br>
Into the air<br>
Go their arms</p>
<p>Show em your palms<br>
We’re all waving<br>
They just dont care<br>
To be a part<br>
Nothing is wrong</p>
<p>When you dont look<br>
They go crazy<br>
When you’re not there<br>
In their hearts<br>
Everything’s wrong<br>
Sofa king wrong<br>
We’re never wrong</p>
<p>You hurry home<br>
You stayed too long<br>
Past grave and stone<br>
You shout -- Save The Soul of The Song</p>
