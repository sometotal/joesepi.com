# Totally wrong

You are totally wrong  
I should write you a song  
I could tell right from the  start you were hitting the bong (damn)  
At the beginning…  we were singing…  both of our songs  
I want to sail away  
Come back with more swords on another day

You say you wont you know you will  
Wouldn’t want to die upon that hill  
Couldn’t leave well enough alone  
Shoulda wrote it in a poem

You were totally gone  
When you pulled up in your Cadillac right next to my home (damn)  
I want to sail away  
Come back with more force to blow you away

When you were gone  
I wrote you this song  
I took you apart  
And put you back wrong

You say you were strong  
But you were totally wrong  
When the going got tough  
You were totally gone

When you were one  
The parts were the sum  
The best was the rest  
And it was still yet to come

The way you went long  
Turned left and were gone  
In the blink of an eye  
Unlimited brawn

They think that you’re ill  
From the wind comes the will  
Look once from the sill  
And go in for the kill 

Bright lights in the dark  
Hit it out of the park  
Where the west was won  
They’ve made you a gun

This song should be sung  
From the back to the front  
Spoke highly of you  
‘Cept when they called you a cunt

This is the end  
My only friend  
This is the end  
Here we are again

Wish you were now  
Totally gone  
Thought we knew real love  
Totally wrong
