# Hana Hou

Jumped into a perfect time her lips were almost home  
Sweetness take a pic of this one half could make it whole  
When she got off the train  
And jumped into my truck again  
The crowd chants hana hou

With a smirk she called me darling and said lets go  
Said that there was a little damage, and thought that I should know  
Some ska with Scottish Dave  
found a bench at the beach real late  
The crowd chants hana hou

Gonna ride a north shore wave  
Dirt queen without breath haole  
Gonna skate the day away
