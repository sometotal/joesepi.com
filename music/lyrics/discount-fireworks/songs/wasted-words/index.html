<h1>Wasted Words</h1>
<p>Oh... tried to get out of the way<br>
Oh... it hurts the most to be alive<br>
Oh... I’m just waiting for the day<br>
Oh... The last one to survive</p>
<p>Its so sad we tried our best not to die<br>
All the wasted words the when the how the why</p>
<p>The when the how the why<br>
From the ground up to the sky</p>
<p>Oh... We can barely find a way<br>
Oh... Been looking steady for awhile</p>
<p>Still tryin our best to find another way</p>
<p>Oh... we tried our best not to die<br>
Oh... they’ve come to take me for a ride</p>
<p>They’ve come to take me for a ride<br>
From the ground up to the sky</p>
