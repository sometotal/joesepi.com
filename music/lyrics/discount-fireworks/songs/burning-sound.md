# Burning Sound

I’m gonna run a campaign  
Straight into the ground  
I’m gonna do some cocaine  
And find some dick and push him around

I’m gonna light some matches  
And throw them to the ground  
Into a trail of gasoline  
And listen to the burning sound

Its the Burning Sound  
And its burning down down down  
We can sit and watch the whole fucking thing burn down

I’m gonna steal a hot rod  
And blow this fucking town  
Meet me on the mountain  
While this shit cools down

I’m gonna become grizzly   
Bear, naked and brown  
Watch me tear your face off  
With the force of the burning sound  

Its the Burning Sound  
And its burning down down down  
We can sit and watch this whole fucking thing burn down

I’m gonna light some matches  
And throw them to the ground  
Into a trail of gasoline  
And listen to the burning sound

Its the Burning Sound  
And its burning down down down  
We can sit and watch the whole fucking thing burn down
