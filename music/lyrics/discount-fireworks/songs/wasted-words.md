# Wasted Words

Oh... tried to get out of the way  
Oh... it hurts the most to be alive  
Oh... I’m just waiting for the day  
Oh... The last one to survive

Its so sad we tried our best not to die  
All the wasted words the when the how the why  

The when the how the why  
From the ground up to the sky

Oh... We can barely find a way  
Oh... Been looking steady for awhile

Still tryin our best to find another way

Oh... we tried our best not to die  
Oh... they’ve come to take me for a ride

They’ve come to take me for a ride  
From the ground up to the sky
