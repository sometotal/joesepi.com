# Almost Home

Almost home  
We barely made it  
We took too long  
To even start

Dip in the pond  
We can wade in  
Waving our arms  
And seein stars  
We could be wrong

Things have just stalled  
But they’ve been fading  
Waving our arms  
Was a good start  
We could be wrong  
We’re probably wrong  
We’re never wrong

Went down to the bar  
We took the ladies  
Taken by the arm  
Its the way it starts

Sit in the stall  
When we were waiting  
None of us alarmed  
Thought we were smart  
We could be wrong

Jokers for all  
I’ll see you later  
You dealt some good cards  
But now its dark  
We were so wrong  
Totally wrong  
We’re never wrong

You hurry home  
You stayed too long  
Past grave and stone  
You shout -- Save The Soul of The Song

Honesty disarms  
Leaves them lazy  
Into the air  
Go their arms

Show em your palms  
We’re all waving  
They just dont care  
To be a part  
Nothing is wrong

When you dont look  
They go crazy  
When you’re not there  
In their hearts  
Everything’s wrong  
Sofa king wrong  
We’re never wrong

You hurry home  
You stayed too long  
Past grave and stone  
You shout -- Save The Soul of The Song
