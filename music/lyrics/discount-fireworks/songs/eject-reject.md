# Eject Reject

I saw you runnin from your mama up on 4th St, Eastside  
Great grandpapa left you something cherry bronco sweet ride  
Great grandmama call you up you said fuck off and good bye  
Real true story in the kitchen I was there with my own eyes  

Eject, Reject  
Be Kind,  Rewind

You’ve got something born of nothing burnt down barnyard wheat high  
Real or imagined friend cadavers give you several high fives  
They’ll be books about crooks you avoided did time  
Brains and the know how, skipped the housegow where’d you end up, preach high  

Eject, Reject  
Be Kind,  Rewind
