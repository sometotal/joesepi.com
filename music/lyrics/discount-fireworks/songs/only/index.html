<p>5/4/Only</p>
<p>Only<br>
A space reserved for only me</p>
<p>Oh, I can find<br>
The forever light to blind<br>
Only</p>
<p>Oh Oh… Only<br>
One better sight that’s gone<br>
Dead end bulb awaits the light<br>
Only</p>
<p>What good is it all<br>
If you dont know how to fall<br>
You can’t get up You can’t get down Can’t you see?<br>
What comes around<br>
Goes around and smacks you down to the ground<br>
A pound of flesh is the least that you’ll be...</p>
<p>Oh Oh Oh Oh... Only</p>
<p>What good is it all<br>
If you dont know how to fall<br>
You can’t get up You can’t get down Can’t you see?<br>
What comes around<br>
Goes around and smacks you down to the ground<br>
A pound of flesh is the least that you’ll be...</p>
<p>You’re just staring at the ground<br>
Gotta get up get your feet<br>
Can’t hear a sound<br>
Come and stand next to me<br>
Waves floating around and around<br>
And around and around<br>
The winter, the heavens, the sea will come calling the swell is the last thing you’ll see</p>
<p>Oh Oh... Only<br>
What say you now you know<br>
The one who wakes the night<br>
Only</p>
