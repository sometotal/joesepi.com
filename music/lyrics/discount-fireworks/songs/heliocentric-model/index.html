<h1>Heliocentric Model</h1>
<p>I hear the car door slamming shut<br>
Broken arrows under my foot<br>
And they're pointing at you<br>
A heliocentric model<br>
With you in the center of the sun</p>
<p>No cares for my cares<br>
Nothing means enough<br>
For you<br>
The only star in the universe<br>
To do everything first</p>
<p>The comfort of everyone<br>
Is to know that you haven't won<br>
Fuck You<br>
I hope this song ends first<br>
Before the second verse</p>
<p>What happened last night<br>
Got in a fight<br>
Someone half right<br>
Turned out the light<br>
What happened last night<br>
Got in a fight</p>
<p>You keep coming<br>
Round and round you just keep coming</p>
<p>And it's all about you</p>
<p>Before you ever came to town<br>
I knew that things wouldn't be so good<br>
And now loves turned me around<br>
And now you've eaten all my food<br>
You never knew which way to go<br>
You should've headed up to the snow<br>
Up to the mountains<br>
Where there's more snow</p>
