# July

Discovered there’s a world less painted in the night  
Discolored in a rawness hidden from the light  
Hidden in a fortress kept well out of sight  
Held up as a portrait something isn’t right

Sedated in July

Standing on the stage set singing is a lie  
Holding this guitar neck saying it’s alright  
Could I just decide to stay up here all night  
Or pull the plug and call it; wave and say goodbye

Sedated in July

a world less painted in the night  
rawness hidden from the light  
in a fortress kept well out of sight  
portrait something isn’t right  
Sedated in July

Sedated in July
