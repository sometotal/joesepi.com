So things have been pretty busy round here and I forgot to even post about our appearance on <a href="http://myspace.com/radioonechicago" title="Radio One Chicago on WLUW on MySpace" target="_blank">RadioOne Chicago</a> on <a href="http://wluw.org" title="WLUW Chicago" target="_blank">WLUW</a>. We had a really great time and it was all broadcast live and was also recorded. The recording came out pretty well and it is a great document of the band with <a href="http://www.joesepi.com/gallery/v/shows/roydale-showcase/joesepi/reggies30.jpg.html" title="We love you Faiz!" target="_blank">Faiz</a>, who has now moved on.

The songs are up on our MySpace page: <a href="http://myspace.com/joesepi" title="*joesepi* on WLUW on MySpace" target="_blank">myspace/joesepi</a>
