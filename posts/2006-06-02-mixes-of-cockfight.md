There are four to choose from. We need to pick one and send it off. Weigh in if you like. Two are from AJ and two are from Mike. Its a battle royale (with cheese). We took the mixes we got from <a target="_blank" title="Site is coming soon, I swear!" href="http://www.reelsoundschicago.com">Fig at Reelsounds</a> and blended Bill back into the mix and voila!

*Edit: We have chosen a mix, so there is only the <a title="The one the only." target="_blank" href="/audio/skwm">one up there now</a>. Will be mailing it off today.
