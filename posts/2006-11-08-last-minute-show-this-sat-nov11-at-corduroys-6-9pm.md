My good friend <a target="_blank" title="The Magic Spot" href="http://www.myspace.com/themagicspotproductions">Rich Salamander</a> called me up the night before last about <a target="_blank" title="The Show listing on myspace" href="http://collect.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=music.showDetails&#038;Band_Show_ID=8927306&#038;friendid=35992284">this show</a>. He was going to play acoustic, but no longer can do it. This will be a great show at a little cafe that just started hosting rock bands, <a target="_blank" title="Calm Booking" href="http://myspace.com/calmbooking">Corduroy&#8217;s</a>.

An excellent band from Wichita, KS, will be playing as well &#8211; <a target="_blank" title="The Paper Airplanes, from Wichita, KS" href="http://myspace.com/paperairplanes">The Paper Airplanes</a>. I am hoping to get the folks from their label, <a target="_blank" title="54|40 or Fight!" href="http://fiftyfourfortyorfight.com">54ยบ40 or Fight!</a> to come down as well and maybe talk to me about the new album. Some of our good friends are/were on that label, such as <a target="_blank" title="31 Knots" href="http://31knots.com/">31Knots</a> and <a target="_blank" title="The Planet The" href="http://www.myspace.com/theplanetthe">The Planet The</a>, and also some other great bands like <a target="_blank" title="The Life and Times" href="http://www.thelifeandtimes.com/">The Life and Times</a>, <a target="_blank" title="Can't find them anywhere now, except on Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/Bottom-Curve-Houston/dp/B0000ALFYP">Houston</a>, and <a target="_blank" title="Someone else talking about them..." href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2003/01/31/135023.php">Abilene</a>.

**Hope you can make it out:**
