GO see the mess we created. The band list is too large to list here (ok, I am just to lazy) &#8211; Visit the <a title="!OUCHO! fest rulz !!" target="_blank" href="http://www.pensamplivox.com/oucho">!OUCHO!fest page</a> for more general info on the festivities.

And in case you missed it, we are looking to put together a compilation CD of one track per artist of the night. This is an endeavor we mean to do each year, but I think this time its for real.
