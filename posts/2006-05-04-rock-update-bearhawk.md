Even though things were burning hot in the forest, the dynamic duo of bear and hawk realized that there was too much else to do to continue fanning flames and burning bushes.

While the hawk is not done, we are taking a break. With multiple other projects in the works, a pause in action was needed.

Things are still moving ahead in tangent bear ways. A Softshell recording is in process (basically acousto hawk) and we do have a show in June that may feature the drumnastics of our good friend Mouse (Jim will be biking). I&#8217;ll keep you posted.
