Have any of you out there heard of this site? It&#8217;s like internet radio, only better. You sign up (free) and download their little &#8220;audio scrobbler&#8221; (dont ask). Then when you listen to music on your computer (iTunes or whatever) it takes note of what you&#8217;ve been listening and recommends music based on that. You can also search for artists and listen to &#8216;radio&#8217; based on similar artists. It&#8217;s really hard to explain, but fun and stuff.

This is where that little graphic to the right is coming from. I am on there as <a target="_blank" title="joesepi and the kiss pandas" href="http://last.fm/user/joesepi">joesepi</a>, feel free to look me up and add me as your friend. We can sit around and make mix tapes like the old days.

I am also adding our records up there &#8211; see <a title="Pensamplivox - pvxrecords on last.fm" target="_blank" href="http://last.fm/label/Pensamplivox">Pensamplivox</a>.

EDIT: And you know what else? I am finding this really useful as I clean out my ridiculously large music library. I can scroll through things and click on something I hadn&#8217;t heard. With the Audio Scrobbler open, it instantly gives me a brief bio. For example, I didn&#8217;t realize <a title="A Certain Ratio" target="_blank" href="http://www.acrmcr.com/">A Certain Ratio</a> were right along <a title="Gang of Four" target="_blank" href="http://www.gangoffour.co.uk/">Gang of Four</a> and <a title="Cabaret Voltaire" target="_blank" href="http://www.thecabaretvoltaire.com/">Cabaret Voltaire</a> in pioneering the post-punk/funk stuff from the UK in the late 70&#8242;s. This last.fm, I like.
