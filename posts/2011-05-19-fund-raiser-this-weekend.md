It looks like I might be playing a fund raiser this weekend for a legal defense fund regarding my neighborhood assoc. and the city of Peekskill against some shady developers (building, not web).

If so, it will probably be a mix of some classic covers and some crowd friendly originals. I am going to try to squeeze in the Bitter Tears song too because it is just too awesome. 

If you want details, message me.
