We took a stab at recording the <a title="Love the Worm" target="_blank" href="http://www.silkwom.net">SKWM</a> song last night. Mike got their early to set up the vast array of nice mics that he and AJ own, and also to get our little closet of a &#8216;control room&#8217; set back up again. (AJ would like to thank the <a title="one of EA's finest" target="_blank" href="http://www.russianrecording.com/">Angry Russian</a> for his endless advice on mic purchases.)

We started off recording the drums and my gtr first and I sang a scratch vocal into a very nice condenser mic (no PA, no monitor).

Things got off to a slow start as Mike and AJ fried a transistor and I fried my Fender Twin. In the meantime, Nate and I worked on the drums in the song and came up with something rather nice &#8211; should have a good feel when all is said and done.

Bill stepped up to the plate after that and laid down some very nice add&#8217;l gtr. Got a good tone mixing a ribbon mic close and one of the mics on the toms.

Mike finished off the night with some bass direct. I am not sure how it turned out cuz I had to split. Twas getting late. Maybe we will throw up a working version as we finish it up on our very own <a title="The many working versions of this skwm recording" target="_blank" href="/audio/skwm">recording a SKWM song page</a>.

**quick notes on previous attempts:**

First try: (around 3/7)  
Ok, so this is the story of my life; and the story with most of my recordings -  
poor/loose planning + lots of luck (good and bad) = interesting results  
* Go to record at my recently vacated studio apartment (hopefully new tenant moves in tomorrow)  
* Have nice <a target="_blank" title="Previous employer, employs my friends" href="http://www.shure.com">Shure</a> condenser mic, but the cable in my little bag has a 1/4&#8243; end (no phantom power)  
* Doesn&#8217;t matter cuz, I haven&#8217;t installed protools onto my newly reformatted laptop yet.  
* Also, no core audio driver, so either way, can&#8217;t use MBox for phantom power or any other type of input.  
NOTE: just moved, all shit in a pile at new place, currently staying at girlfriend&#8217;s place until situations are in place.  
* So now I am stuck with the internal mic on my laptop and GarageBand.  
* No place to sit (moved out) &#8212; sitting on floor.  
* No internet connection &#8212; don&#8217;t know the words by heart, have to sit and type them out, can&#8217;t get to <span class="st" id="st">SKWM</span> site for lyrics, end up making some of them up.  
* Friend there, helps with back up vox and adds thumbed bassline while I do lead on one guitar.  
* Only 2 beers  
* But neighbor gives us a &#8220;Bravo!&#8221; from outside the door at the end of the last take.  
SO&#8230;.  
It came out interesting, I could re-record it, but often times I stick with the way something came out &#8211; for better or for worse. Let&#8217;s just say it has personality.

Second try: (around 4/5)  
I recorded acoustic/vox up at <a target="_blank" title="Louderness" href="http://www.reelsoundschicago.com">Reelsounds</a>. I have tried to work on it some on my own. I think my mBox is fucked up. And the tracks I laid down are somewhat subpar &#8211; in recording quality. Also, seems a little hurried and lacks the feel you get when you record vox/gtr at the same time, which my version of this song needs badly &#8211; that feel.
