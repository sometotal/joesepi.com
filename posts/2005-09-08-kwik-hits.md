- Bearhawk finished mastering.  
- BooKoo&#8217;s finished mastering.  
- Got a practice space yesterday with Bill Sprowl and Camilo Pena. Gonna play drums with those guys on my off days. (like I have any off days, see previous post.)  
- Tonight is the second night playing with Dan Smith of Salvo Beta, among others.  
- Also tonight, we are going to discuss this year&#8217;s 7th Annual Oucho BBq fest. Will be a benefit for Doug, John and Michael. Need to work out some details and ask the appropriate bands.  
- Need to organize the music from the recent Sepi Sessions up at Reelsounds. Focus on Dahlquist songs first.  
- Maybe someday I&#8217;ll play my guitar and write a new song.
