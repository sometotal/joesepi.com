<img border="1" align="right" alt="Is that a beard? A beard of fire maybe." title="Is that a beard? A beard of fire maybe." style="margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px" src="http://www.joesepi.com/gallery/d/1732-4/IMG_3828.jpg" />Hey, I added the <a target="_blank" title="See the Rock!" href="/gallery/v/shows/subt_02/">photos from the last show</a> up to the gallery. There&#8217;s shots of us, taken by my girl, and shots of <a target="_blank" title="Hunky Rock Stars!" href="http://www.systemandstation.net">System and Station</a>, taken by me. Plus I have been customizing the gallery some too. You can&#8217;t leave comments on the photos yet (working on it!), but you can leave comments to the blog posts.

[How&#8217;s it look?][1]
