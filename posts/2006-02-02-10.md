It&#8217;s been 4 months and I haven&#8217;t written a lick. Maybe it was that insane job that I thought was great and turned out to be the worst place ever &#8211; went in to quit two days after xmas only to find out they were firing most of the design staff, including me. Took it with a smile and left the bridge unburned, which turned out to be a good thing when I was trying to get my last check.

My lack of writing may also have to do with that special girl. It has been 4 months and things are still great. Just super. Thanks for asking.
