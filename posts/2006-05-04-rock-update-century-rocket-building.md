The Building goes onward and upward to the sky like a scraper.

Dan is a manlike machine behind the kit and has been proving a strong asset to the feel and smell of new and old songs alike (i like). Moves are being planned and steps are being taken. The SKuLL SKiLL record is a mere couple weeks away from being pressed, manufactured and shipped to the stoop of pvx records. The booking wheels are in motion as well (we had a great show lined up and then shot down &#8211; too bad).

This for sure will be the Century for Building Rockets.
