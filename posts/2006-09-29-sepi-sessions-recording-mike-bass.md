She takes wonderful photos and is happy to share them with us and thusly, with you. She is going to take band shots of us soon, as soon as we can get all five of us in the same room. That should start some rumors: &#8216;<a title="We do too!" target="_blank" href="http://www.joesepi.com/gallery/v/recording/sepi-sessions_mike/prac-5.jpg.html">We don&#8217;t get along</a>&#8216;; &#8216;<a title="C'mon, just do as I say and we will be stars!" target="_blank" href="http://www.joesepi.com/gallery/v/recording/sepi-sessions_mike/prac-8.jpg.html">Sepi&#8217;s ego is out of control</a>&#8216;; &#8216;<a title="You smelt it, you dealt it!" target="_blank" href="http://www.joesepi.com/gallery/v/recording/sepi-sessions_mike/prac-31.jpg.html">Nate&#8217;s gas is out of control</a>&#8216;; &#8216;<a title="Is not!" target="_blank" href="http://www.joesepi.com/gallery/v/recording/sepi-sessions_mike/prac-30.jpg.html">Bill&#8217;s on drugs</a>&#8216;. All of which are far from the truth (except <a target="_blank" title="hot or not?" href="http://www.hotornot.com/r/?eid=AUESOEB&#038;key=XBW">my ego</a>).
