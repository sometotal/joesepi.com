Hi @friends!

I wanted to tell you about [this great show](https://www.facebook.com/events/877677052327977/), happening this Saturday at [Division Street Guitars](http://divisionstreetguitars.com/). It will feature the irrepressible [Least Best Beast](http://leastbestbeast.com), the unremorseful [Apologetics](https://www.facebook.com/TheApologeticsNY/), the singular [JD Gambrell](https://www.facebook.com/JD-Gambrell-1474645529509794/), the all-inclusive [All My Friends](https://www.facebook.com/allmyfriendsmusic/) and the ever-so-dashing [Whiskey Neat](https://www.facebook.com/Whiskey-Neat-230950130433605/).

Least Best Beast will be debuting a few new songs that we are hoping to record early next year. Come out, get your groove on, buy a vintage guitar if ya wanna, ... generally "get into it!"

As usual, the show is all ages, $5 and BYO(Beverage). Everything kicks off at 8pm and I will install a lolly jack under the dance floor before the show. No worries, we will be able to shake our respective booties all night long.
