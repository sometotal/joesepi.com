The skit went well. <a title="Miss Mia is everywhere" target="_blank" href="http://www.miapark.com">Miss Mia</a> was my Jessica. We shared the episode with <a title="They be hairy, They be Beasty" target="_blank" href="http://www.bloodshotrecords.com/artists/weehairybeasties/">The Wee Hairy Beasties</a> (local luminaries such as <a target="_blank" title="Jon Langford on Bloodshot" href="http://www.bloodshotrecords.com/artists/jonlangford">Jon Langford</a>, <a target="_blank" title="Kelly Hogan on Bloodshot" href="http://www.bloodshotrecords.com/artists/kellyhogan">Kelly Hogan</a>, <a target="_blank" title="Sally Timms on Bloodshot" href="http://www.bloodshotrecords.com/artists/sallytimms">Sally Timms</a> and the <a target="_blank" title="Devil in a Woodpile on Bloodshot" href="http://www.bloodshotrecords.com/artists/devilinawoodpile">Devil in the Woodpile</a>), who were all very cordial. (Jon reminded me that he did a song for <a title="Found Extras" target="_blank" href="http://www.foundmagazine.com/andmore">Found on the 7&#8243;</a> they released.)

Anyway, just wanted to let you know that things went off without a hitch and thought I would share the <a title="Dear Jessica for Chicagogo" target="_blank" href="/sessions/Jessicca-chicagogomix.mp3">new mix for Dear Jessica</a>. Ongoing progress can be found on the <a title="He's a session man." target="_blank" href="http://www.joesepi.com/sessions">sessions page</a>.

I&#8217;ll post the video of the performance as soon as I get it from Jake.
