I don&#8217;t even know what to say about last week&#8217;s events. They were historic and monumental. I wish I could sit here and recount every moment of the weekend but I cannot &#8212; it would do T&#038;G&#8217;s anniversary no justice as this was the best &#8216;music festival&#8217; I have ever attended. Not just for the music, but also the venue, the attitude, the people&#8230; everything all added up to a fantastic and memorable weekend.
