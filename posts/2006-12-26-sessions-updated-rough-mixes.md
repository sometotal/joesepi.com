I dont know if I have mentioned this (check the archives, *hole!), but I have updated the <a target="_blank" title="Sepi Sessions!!" href="http://www.joesepi.com/sessions">Sessions page</a>. There are new &#8216;rough mixes&#8217; of all the songs. The previous mixes were very old and the new ones include contributions from such friends as: <a target="_blank" title="Michael the Angry Russian" href="http://www.myspace.com/michaeltheangryrussian">MTAR</a>, <a target="_blank" title="Neslo!!" href="http://www.myspace.com/jamesneslo">James Olsen</a>, Antoine, and more. Plus, the latest mix from Dear Jessica is there.  
Enjoy! (Don't you love old posts with Myspace links? Do any of these links work anymore?)
