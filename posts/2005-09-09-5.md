I think it is a combination of cosmic stuff and mysticism mixed with science. It takes a lot of faith, but there&#8217;s physical energy and intangible luck &#8212; believing in theories and the abstract put together like &#8230;

from the web: The combining of lighter elements into heavier ones. For lighter elements (eg, hydrogen, helium, life) this process releases energy. Fusion is how stars produce energy, and is being researched as a way to produce power on Earth.

Real power. Like ninja power. [Ninja&#8217;s are totally cool][1].
