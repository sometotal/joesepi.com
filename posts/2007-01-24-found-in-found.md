<img border="1" align="right" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 15px 15px" alt="Way to go MySpace, breaking images: Found #1" title="Found #1" src="http://myspace-120.vo.llnwd.net/00635/02/14/635544120_m.jpg" />Just found out we have been featured in <a target="_blank" title="News of the Found" href="http://whatsup.foundmagazine.com/">Found Magazine News</a>. We finally got a good (great, even) mix of Dear Jessica and they <a target="_blank" title="Dear Jessica on Found Magazine" href="http://whatsup.foundmagazine.com/?p=96">threw it up on their site</a>. In case you dont know, <a target="_blank" title="Writing about written for Found Magazine" href="http://www.joesepi.com/blog/2006/08/18/dear-jessica/">the song was written for Found Magazine</a>, so this day was not a surprise &#8212; just a long time in the making.

Thanks to <a target="_blank" title="The Crew page" href="http://foundmagazine.com/contact">Jason and Davy and the whole Found crew</a>, even the <a target="_blank" title="Dirty dirty found" href="http://www.dirtyfound.com/">dirty ones</a>.
