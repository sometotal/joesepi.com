Where have I been for the last 2 years, almost 3 years?  
That is not the point. Where was I last night at about 5pm? That  
one I will answer: on the train working on mixing Dear Jessica  
vocals. As it stands now, there are 3 vocal tracks for me, 2 of  
Thea Lux, and 6, count &#8216;em 6, of James Olsen. James and Thea both  
do a great job and I am doing my best to have that come through in  
a way that doesn&#8217;t saturate an already crowded mix. Instead of  
having my vocals doubled and tripled all up in front with some  
panning, I decided to focus on one of mine and pan hard the other  
two but pull them way back for some color rather than a full  
frontal vocal attack.
