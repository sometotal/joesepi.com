A night at the beach. A beer and some wine. Some pups and toys. Waves with swimming. Conversation and sitting. Light smoking darkness away from traffic. Sunset on the sky, clouds and birds pull a dog&#8217;s eye. Boot scoot and boogie. Slippery rocks, stumble out. Monkey mouth hound bites softly when unexpected. New Jersey stories sound true to the movies. Surfer Guy grabs glasses to make us all elegant, but almost loses the bottle below the wet shelf. A night easy comes without plans when wet shorts end up hung on the stairs.
