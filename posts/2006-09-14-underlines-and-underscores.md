Getting way out of here  
What&#8217;s to fear  
Shards of truth coming out of your ear  
These things are like thoughts  
Words are for naught  
At least for the next year  
Sipping last past  
Makes great for the cast  
But all you ever find is an eyelash in your beer  
Glue is not needed for things not seated  
Come fun rain or shine cant be beated  
Whats truth for the lie  
Underscores and underlines  
What you&#8217;ve paid for in dimes  
Comes out in the end  
As Free  
As Breath  
As Bread  
As Fortune  
As Dirt  
As Air  
As Time  
As Face  
As Fine [.]
