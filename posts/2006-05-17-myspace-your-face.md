Hey Kids, I created pages for our other outfits/endeavors/outlets. Go be a friend:

<a target="_blank" title="MySpace - Century Rocket Building" href="http://myspace.com/centuryrocketbuilding">myspace.com/centuryrocketbuilding</a>  
<a target="_blank" title="MySpace - Bearhawk" href="http://myspace.com/bearhawk">myspace.com/bearhawk</a>  
<a target="_blank" title="MySpace - Reelsounds" href="http://myspace.com/reelsounds">myspace.com/reelsounds</a>

There are tunes on all the pages, and the Reelsounds page has music from: <a target="_blank" title="Century Rocket Building" href="http://www.pensamplivox.com/crb">Century Rocket Building</a>, <a target="_blank" title="Bearhawk" href="http://www.pensamplivox.com/bearhawk">Bearhawk</a>, <a target="_blank" title="Farm Team" href="http://www.pensamplivox.com/farmteam">Farm Team</a>, and <a target="_blank" title="Cornfed" href="http://www.freemarvin.com">Cornfed</a>. All three pages are pretty bare so far, but will be expanded upon in the coming days/weeks/months.
