<span class="postbody">Ok, my wonderful girlfriend bought me this stereo for my birthday. Although my birthday is next monday, she bought it last weekend and when she realized she couldn&#8217;t carry it up to our 3rd floor apartment, she had to give it to me early so I could help her get it out of her car and into our home.</span>

I haven&#8217;t done any research on it yet, so if anyone has any enlightening info or advice (care), please chime in. Otherwise, I just wanted to share how cool this fucking thing is.

Note:  
- it is a General Electric I think from 1963  
- the speakers fold out and all three speakers are &#8216;wireless&#8217;.  
- the record player folds down (it is a Garrard)  
- it totally works in every way (a little dirty)  
- it has 4 speeds on the record player  
- the other side (opposite the record player) folds out slightly to store albums in there  
- it has inputs for &#8216;tape&#8217; (rca jacks &#8211; ie iPod)
