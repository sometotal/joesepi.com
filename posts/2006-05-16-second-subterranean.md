Show went well. Twas great really. Mahle (<a target="_blank" title="Sybris" href="http://myspace.com/sybris">Sybris</a>) did sound again. It turns out, he did sound for a show we (one of my bands) did with <a target="_blank" title="System and Station Rocks!" href="http://www.systemandstation.net">System and Station</a> a long time ago at the Prodigal Son when it was being booked by Brian of <a target="_blank" title="Chicago Booking" href="http://www.mpshows.com">MPshows</a>.

We swapped out the <a target="_blank" title="SKWM" href="http://www.silkworm.net">Silkworm</a> song in the <a target="_blank" title="The *joesepi* Setlist -- study it!!" href="/audio/setlist.php">set</a>, <a target="_blank" title="joesepi does skwm" href="http://www.joesepi.com/audio/skwm">Cockfight of Feelings</a>, for a song from the <a target="_blank" title="A recording in progress" href="http://www.joesepi.com/sessions">sepi sessions</a>, Heliocentric Model. Dean (now of <a target="_blank" title="Chevelle used to sound like Tool" href="http://www.chevelleinc.com/">Chevelle</a> fame) helped me re-arrange the song and it can be quite challenging, so we decided to wait until this second show to trot it out like the racehorse it is. Surprisingly, we did quite well with it.

The other bands were good too, <a target="_blank" title="ST Monroe" href="http://www.myspace.com/stmonroe">ST Monroe</a> and <a target="_blank" title="Digging in the Dirt" href="http://www.tonsofpeyote.com/">Archaeology</a>, but System and Station rocked! Those guys were on top of their shit that night. They&#8217;ve got a new bass player and drummer, both swell guys, and Ryan and Palmer were both just ripping it up. And Ryan was also playing some keyboards on a fancy little Juno. <a target="_blank" title="Lotec is gone, RIP" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/landoftheelcaminos">Dan Fanelli</a> and I were talking about how the new drummer is such a pro. And the bass player was wicked intense, like he was one big vein pulsing, about to pop. The new songs sounded great.
