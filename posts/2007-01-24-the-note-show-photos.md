Once again, our good friend, Rana, took this shots. And there are pics of two of the other three bands as well (sorry, Grackles &#8211; we were there, but the camera ran out of batteries).

You can also find these photos and more at <a target="_blank" title="Flickr me? Flickr You!" href="http://flickr.com/photos/joesepi">Flickr</a> and <a target="_blank" title="Google does everything!" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/joesepi">Google&#8217;s Picasa</a>.

More news coming as I am compressing some video from the <a title="Photos from the Devil's Show" target="_blank" href="http://www.joesepi.com/gallery/v/shows/elboroom_666/">Devil&#8217;s Show</a> and some other things are bubbling in the tank.
