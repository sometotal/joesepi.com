We&#8217;re really excited about this &#8212; it&#8217;s going to be a BLAST! We were going to do our SKWM cover, but have opted to try and finish recording Dear Jessica because of it&#8217;s kid friendly factor. I am also trying to convince a special someone to be my Jessica so we can sorta &#8216;act-out&#8217; the song.

I am not sure when this episode will air, but I will keep you posted. Regardless, Dancers of all ages are encouraged to come to the tv studio and git yer groov on!
