**As a technologist**, my two main drivers are advancing the web platform forward and advancing the web community forward. I try to keep pretty busy doing this sort of stuff as [an advocate](/about/work/advocacy) and [an engineer](/about/work/engineering).

I have been with IBM for a few years now and I couldn't be happier doing the work that I do with the people around me. Before arriving at IBM, I had spent time at companies such as: [Adobe](https://adobe.com)/[Behance](https://be.net"), [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com), [Credit Suisse](https://www.credit-suisse.com), [IAC/InterActiveCorp](https://www.iac.com), [Ogilvy & Mather](https://www.ogilvy.com), [Sears](https://www.sears.com), and [a few others](https://www.mrmessina.com). Read more about my [engineering](/engineering/) and [dev advocacy](/advocacy/) work.


**As a musician**, my name has been in the credits on the sleeve of a bunch of records, including with such bands as [Century Rocket Building](https://centuryrocketbuilding.bandcamp.com), [Bearhawk](https://open.spotify.com/artist/64FGTThPGeQgCHkGyz1if8), [Friends of Enemies](https://foe21.bandcamp.com), and [too many more](https://audio.pvxrecords.com), including my own [solo work](https://joesepi.bandcamp.com). Having toured the country and resided in many cities, I have an extensive network of musician friends, several of which have collaborated with me on an upcoming release, [Lost+Found](https://soundcloud.com/joesepi/sets/lost-and-found).
