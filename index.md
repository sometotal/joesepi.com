<h2 style="margin-top:0"><a href="/music">Joe Sepi is a <span style="text-decoration:underline">musician</span></a></h2>

He has been playing in bands since he was 15 and moved all around the country chasing music. His first band’s release was produced by Built to Spill’s Doug Martsch and his forthcoming release features friends from Silkworm, Chevelle, Wrong War, and even Lil Bub’s human. While he’s been in many bands you’ve likely never heard of, the only constants in this journey of sound have been Joe’s heart-on-sleeve voice, magic rocket guitar, and change. His new band, <a href="https://discountfireworks.band">**Discount Fireworks**</a>, is just taking flight.</br>
