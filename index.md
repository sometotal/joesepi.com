He has been playing in bands since he was 15 and moved all around the country chasing music adventures. His first bandâ€™s release was produced by Built to Spillâ€™s Doug Martsch and his forthcoming release features friends from Silkworm, Chevelle, Wrong War, and even Lil Bubâ€™s human. While heâ€™s been in many bands youâ€™ve likely never heard of, the only constants in this journey of sound have been Joeâ€™s heart-on-sleeve voice, magic rocket guitar, and change. His new band, <a href="https://discountfireworks.band">**Discount Fireworks**</a>, is about to explode. LOOK OUT! ðŸ’¥</br>
