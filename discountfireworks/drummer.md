# Discount Fireworks seeks drummer person

New Haven rock band finds most drummers are already in too many bands. If you are a drummer with time for another project, please reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joe_sepi), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/joesepi/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/joesepi) or via [email](mailto:joe@joesepi.com).

### Who are Discount Fireworks?

Discount Fireworks is a project led by Joe Sepi and currently backed by Jeff Maleri on bass (Peasant and 63 other bands) and Tom Connolly on drums (Psychic Newborns and Pillowhugger). However, Tom is getting too busy -- something we knew would happen at some point -- and so we are looking to find someone else to jump in.

### What do we want in a drummer person?

You dont need to be Neil Peart. Its okay if you are though.

### What are the options?

Since drummers are hard to come by, we are flexible. Here are some options

#### Help us play our next show

Want to jump in and learn 8-10 of our songs and maybe a cover or two? Great. That would help us to play our next show. What happens after that show can be decided after that show. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

#### Come record on a track or two

We have a music space and hobby studio set up. Come rehearse a song or two and lay down a drum track for us. Or if you have your own space, we can send you guitar, bass and vocals played to a click track for you to lay down something tasty.

#### Be our forever friend

You may just love our songs and think we are good enough as people and want to do something on the regular. If so, a rehearsal once a week would be great but any sort of regular timely interval would suffice. Help us craft these numbers, record these numbers, and perform these numbers. Cool? Cool!

### What do you sound like?

Great question. Here are some tracks we've been working on in rehearsal.

_The drums on all of these tracks are open to new interpretations._
